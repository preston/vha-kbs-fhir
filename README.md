# FHIR Resources, CQL Libraries, Knowledge Artifacts (KNARTS), and Utilities for Veterans Health Administration, Knowledge Based Systems

This repository contains computable clinical knowledge assets and utilities for supporting FHIR and CQL (Clinical Quality Language) capabilities in standards-focused healthcare infrastructures. Command-line utilities are written in TypeScript. Developers may download this library as a standalone utility via NPM, or integrate it into Node-based services to build CDS services or user-level applications. It contains,

* FHIR R4 resources representing CDS concepts such as order sets and questionnaires.
* CQL (Clinical Quality Language) libraries with executable support logic such as conditional expressions and data queries.
* The `vha-kbs-fhir` command-line utility for loading the above into your own FHIR R4 resource server.
* Legacy KNART XML documents used by VHA KBS prior to 202.

This repository does NOT contain:

Authoritative clinical narrative documents used to create these files, such as VA clinical whitepapers, clinical best practice documents, peer reviewed literature, nor other not intended to be directly computable.
